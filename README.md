# Employee Tracker

## Description
This application is a Content Management System (CMS) that functions as an employee manager, interacting with information stored in a database. The server can be ran with Node.js, and uses packages Inquirer, console.table, and MySQL2 to facilitate interaction with the user and operations against a local MySQL instance.

This Employee Tracker was created to meet the requirements of the following user story:
```
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
